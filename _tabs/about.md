- I adapt quickly and connect the dots to understand how things work. If I don't know an answer, I'm not going to pretend I know and give you false information, I'll tell you to give me some time and come back with something useful.
- My journey in the IT world started when I decided to get my CCNA back in 2018, but then I relized that networking is just a small part of the landscape, so I'be been trying to catch up to new technologies ever since.
- I love taking notes, let's say for example I'm learning to deploy wordpress on a docker container in a GCP VM, I'll document the whole process in case I need to re-do it. 
    - I used to manage my notes in Google Docs but it's too slow to load, so migrated all my notes to Obsidian, so now everything is handled as markdown files and automatically uploaded to my github repo.
